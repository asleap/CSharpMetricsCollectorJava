# CSharpMetricsCollectorJava - currently under development
An object-oriented metrics collector for C# projects written as practical part of my thesis.
It uses a JavaCC parser generation with JTB tool grammar pre-processing.
C# 6 grammar was ported from [here](https://github.com/ljw1004/csharpspec).
A set of metrics it collects:
- Chidamber and Kemerer object-oriented metrics suite
- MOOD metrics
